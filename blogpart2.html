        "How Photoshop Reshaped My Pandemic Era"
      </h1>

      <p>
        I didn’t just start Photoshop because I wanted to. It drew my attention
        to how beautiful <strong>graphic designing</strong> truly is, especially
        in <strong>esports</strong>. During a time when everything felt
        uncertain and overwhelming, Photoshop became my
        <strong>safe space</strong>. At first, it was just for fun—clicking
        random buttons and experimenting.
        <strong>Pero habang tumatagal,</strong> I realized na Photoshop wasn’t
        just something I used anymore. It slowly became something that shaped
        who I am today. <br /><br />
        <i
          ><b
            >This blog is about how Photoshop helped me grow, not just
            creatively, but personally.</b

      <h2 class="subheading">How I learned Photoshop during the Pandemic.</h2>
      <p>
        When I first opened Photoshop, I was not ready and I was confused just
        like any child would be. I made my first edit not knowing that it would
        be the start of something beautiful. I gave mini-projects to myself and
        learned everything through <strong>self-learning</strong>. The designs I
        created did not make any sense at first, but instead of getting
        discouraged, I kept trying. Every edit felt like a
        <strong>challenge</strong>, and every mistake felt like a
        <strong>lesson</strong>. <br /><br />
        Photoshop became my way of expressing my true self that I couldn’t
        explain in words. Every free time I had, I edited. When I felt bored, I
        started editing. <strong>Kahit simple lang ang ginagawa ko,</strong> it
        gave me a purpose. Creating something from nothing filled me with
        <strong>happiness</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul class="a">
        <li><strong>Watched free Photoshop tutorials online</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Created mini personal projects</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Practiced editing during my free time</strong></li>
      </ul>

        How and when I started earning money thru editing
      </h2>
      <p>
        I started editing in 2020, and during my first year, I received an
        invitation to join a small team with a salary of
        <strong>**** PHP.</strong> At just 15 years old, I was already earning
        money, which I immediately accepted. That opportunity introduced me to
        the real struggles of being a graphic designer. As the team grew bigger
        in the scene, they began looking for new graphic designers. I eventually
        left because I felt I couldn’t compete yet, so I decided to improve my
        skills. <br /><br />
        After that, I found another job in the same field
        <strong>esports</strong> which also offered a salary of
        <strong>**** PHP.</strong> These new teams later became a second home
        for me. They suggested that I become a
        <strong>live-in editor</strong> at a bootcamp house. Their supportive
        community made everything better for me and their players, which made me
        very happy and helped shape my journey throughout 2021–2022.
      </p>

      <ul class="a">
        <li><strong>Started earning money at the age of 15</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Experienced real pressure</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Entered the professional esports editing scene</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a href="IMAGES/blogpart2/2.webp" target="_blank">
          <img
            src="IMAGES/blogpart2/2.webp"

            class="bio-image"
          />
        </a>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subheading">Who I became because of editing.</h2>
      <p>
        Through editing, I slowly discovered who I truly am. It taught me
        <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, and
        <strong>confidence</strong> in my own skills. I learned how to handle
        pressure, deadlines, and criticism from other people, which helped me
        grow not just as a graphic designer but as a person. Editing gave me an
        identity during a hard time for the whole world. It showed me that
        <strong>passion</strong> and <strong>hard work</strong> can open
        opportunities, <strong>kahit bata pa ako.</strong> Because of Photoshop
        and editing, I became more <strong>motivated</strong>, more
        <strong>creative</strong>, and more <strong>determined</strong>.
      </p>

      <ol class="a">
        <li><strong>Became more disciplined and patient</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Gained confidence in my creativity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Developed a name for myself in the scene</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Photoshop became more than just an editing tool for me; it became a part
        of my life. From learning it during the pandemic, to earning my first
        income, and discovering who I am through editing, every experience
        shaped me into a better version of myself. What started as a simple
        hobby turned into a <strong>passion</strong> and a source of
        <strong>happiness</strong>. Through challenges and struggles, editing
        taught me valuable lessons. This journey reminded me that even during
        difficult times, something meaningful can emerge and change your life
        forever.
