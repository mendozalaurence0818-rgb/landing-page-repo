        "A creative future for my creative mind?"
      </h1>

      <p>
        <i>
          After everything I’ve been through with Graphic designing, I’ve always
          put in my mind that my journey doesn’t stop at learning skills or
          earning money early. What started as a hobby for me slowly turned into
          a passion, and this shaped the future I want to build. I didn’t always
          have a clear plan for my career in IT, but with my past years in
          editing, working with esports teams, and learning from real
          experiences, I began to see where I truly belong. This blog is about
          the career I want to pursue, the skills I still need to improve, and
          how I see myself growing in the next few years.

      <h2 class="subheading">The career I see myself with.</h2>
      <p>
        In the next years, I see myself working professionally in the
        <strong>creative side</strong> of the IT industry, especially in
        <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>digital media</strong> based
        companies. I want to be more than just an editor who follows trends. I
        want to be someone who creates designs with <strong>identity</strong>.
        My experience as a graphic designer during a young age taught me that
        <strong>creativity</strong> can really open opportunities, and I want to
        continue building a career where I can combine
        <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>art</strong>. <br /><br />
        I also want to expand beyond Photoshop. I know that the IT field is
        constantly evolving. In the future, I hope to work with different tools,
        platforms, and even collaborate with developers, or marketing teams. My
        goal is to become a well-known and the best creative professional who
        understands both design and technology.

      <h2 class="subheading">More learning experience to be gained.</h2>
      <p>
        Even though I already have experience, I know that I still have a lot to
        learn. One of the most important skills I need to improve is
        <strong>consistency</strong>. Working in esports taught me how
        fast-paced and demanding the industry can be, and I want to become more
        disciplined with my time and workflow. I also want to improve my
        <strong>technical</strong> and <strong>logical</strong> skills by
        learning more advanced design techniques and exploring other software
        related to media and IT. <br /><br />
        Aside from technical and logical skills,
        <strong>communication</strong> is very important. Working with teams
        showed me that being able to understand feedback and work under pressure
        is just as important as <strong>creativity</strong>. I want to become
        more confident in sharing my ideas and collaborating with others. These
        skills will help me prepare for bigger opportunities in the future.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheading">A past that can help.</h2>
      <p>
        Starting my editing journey during the pandemic and earning at a young
        age gave me a different perspective on work and responsibility. I
        experienced pressure early, but instead of giving up, it pushed me to
        improve myself. Those moments made me realize that
        <strong>setbacks</strong> are part of growth. Because of that, I am not
        afraid of challenges that may come in my future career. <br /><br />
        My experiences also taught me that <strong>passion</strong> alone is not
        enough <strong>continuous learning</strong> is important. This is why I
        plan to keep practicing, studying, and improving my skills while
        pursuing my education. I want to use what I learned from the past to
        make smarter decisions moving forward.

      <h2 class="subheading">Develop more. Build more.</h2>
      <p>
        As I move forward, I plan to continue developing my skills, exploring
        new technologies, and building a career that I am proud of. My goal is
        not just to earn money, but to create meaningful work and leave a mark
        in the industry I love. Through dedication and continuous learning, I
        believe I can turn my passion into a long-term career and a better
        future for myself.
