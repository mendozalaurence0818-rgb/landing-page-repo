        "Balancing Deadlines: My Life as a Freelance Editor and IT Student"
      </h1>

      <p>
        Balancing work and school during Senior High School was easy for me, but
        when I started college, it slowly began to take a toll on me especially
        when deadlines started piling up. As a freelance editor and an IT
        student, I had to switch my daily routine just to meet both my academic
        requirements and clients expectations. During the first few months in
        college, I was overwhelmed, exhausted, and stressed most of the time.
        But, handling both roles showed me how much I was learning. This blog is
        about my experience switching between these two roles and what it has
        taught me so far.

      <h2 class="subheading">The start of my passion for editing.</h2>
      <p>
        I started editing in 2020 using Photoshop just for fun, mainly for my
        own team since we played competitively in a game called MLBB. Because we
        hosted tournaments, I got close to people I never thought I would meet,
        and that was when I started taking editing and freelancing more
        seriously. I eventually left my team and began earning money at the age
        of 15. We hosted large tournaments with 64 teams, each having five
        players and one manager, which allowed me to build connections with
        around 400 people who knew me by name.

        My struggle of balancing Freelance and Senior High School.
      </h2>
      <p>
        When the pandemic ended and Senior High School started, I became
        inactive for a few months. When I returned, I was invited to work for
        ONIC Philippines and Blacklist International, which I accepted, but I
        only worked with them for one year. After that, I decided to return to
        freelancing, and it paid off. I was able to earn money while focusing on
        my studies, and overall, it was a great experience. However, when
        college started, I lost half of my clients and no longer felt the same
        excitement for editing. I went on hiatus during my first few months as I
        was still adjusting to college, and I did not return to editing for my
        entire first year.
      </p>

            alt="College Experience"
            class="bio-image"
          />
        </a>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subheading">Adjusting to college life.</h2>
      <p>
        This second year, I finally got back into editing. I am currently the
        EVP for Media and Communications for UE Zenith Esports, and it has been
        an amazing experience. The excitement I once felt for editing has
        returned, reminding me why I started in the first place. At the same
        time, I am learning how to balance studying and working as an IT
        student. Studying is still difficult for me because I am a slow learner
        and I know I cannot compete with everyone, but I realized that college
        is not about competition it is about learning at your own pace. Coding
        was especially hard for me since I had no prior experience in Senior
        High School, but when I learned that creativity and visuals also play a
        role in IT, I became more motivated. Balancing work and school is still
        challenging, but once you gain momentum, it becomes manageable. Today, I
        am earning while studying, and that balance is something I am proud of.

        Handling freelance work while studying IT taught me the importance of
        time management and patience. I learned that I cannot do everything at
        once but it is manageable, and is okay to take breaks when needed. This
        experience also made me more confident in handling responsibilities
        outside the classroom. In the future, I plan to continue improving my
        skills in both areas while maintaining a healthier balance between work
        and school.
